/*

For an integer array nums, an inverse pair is a pair of integers [i, j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length and nums[i] > nums[j].

Given two integers n and k, return the number of different arrays consist of numbers from 1 to n such that there are exactly k inverse pairs. Since the answer can be huge, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: Only the array [1,2,3] which consists of numbers from 1 to 3 has exactly 0 inverse pairs.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The array [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] have exactly 1 inverse pair.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000
0 <= k <= 1000
