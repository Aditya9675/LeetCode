/*

You are given a directed graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array edges of size n, indicating that there is a directed edge from node i to node edges[i]. If there is no outgoing edge from node i, then edges[i] == -1.

Return the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return -1.

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node.

 

Example 1:


Input: edges = [3,3,4,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest cycle in the graph is the cycle: 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2.
The length of this cycle is 3, so 3 is returned.
Example 2:


Input: edges = [2,-1,3,1]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no cycles in this graph.
 

Constraints:

n == edges.length
2 <= n <= 105
-1 <= edges[i] < n
edges[i] != i

    public int longestCycle(int[] edges) {
    int ans = -1;

    int[] timeVisited = new int[edges.length];

    for(int i=0;i<edges.length;++i){

      final int startTime = time;
      int u=i;
      while(u != -1 && timeVisited[u]==0){
        timeVisited[u] = time++;
        u = edges[u];
      }
      if(u != -1 && timeVisited[u]>=startTime)
        ans = Math.max(ans,time-timeVisited[u]);
    }

    return ans;    
    }
